2017-??-?? Ahven 2.7
====================

Changes
-------
	* NEWS file renamed to NEWS.txt, LICENSE to LICENSE.txt.
	* GNAT Makefile / comfignat updates:
	  - prefix variable for installation location (note: lowercase)
	  - development / production build settings
	  - directory changed to gnat_linux.
	* Simplified GNAT project file under gnat directory.
	  This can be used on Windows also:
	    gprbuild -p -P gnat\ahven
	* Test_Count_Type is now subtype of Long_Integer with
	  upper limit at 2**31-1. This allows more tests on compilers
	  where Natural is a 16-bit value.

Internal
--------
	* Ahven.Long_AStrings now uses Unbounded_String instead of Bounded_String.
	  This reduces the memory usage and allows therefore more tests.

2015-08-30 Ahven 2.6
====================

Changes
-------
	* Fix release dates in documentation.

2015-08-30 Ahven 2.5
====================

Changes
-------
	* The default build system (Makefile) for GNAT uses now
	  comfignat.mk template. All existing make targets should
	  work in the normal way, but the internals have been
	  changed. See
	  http://tero.stronglytyped.org/building-the-development-version-of-ahven.html
	  for details.

	* Python-sphinx and sphinxcontrol-adadomain packages
	  are now required for building the documentation.
	  Prebuilt documentation is available online at
	  http://docs.ahven-framework.com/2.5/index.html

	* XML_Runner now supports "-s" parameter, which allows
	  one to specify suffix for test class names.
	  Helps with CI systems which expect certain format for
	  the names.
	  Example:
	    my_tests -c -x -s .Test -d results

	* Test runners can now accept multiple test names
	  from the command line. Suggestion from Jacob Sparre Andersen.

	* Test runners have new "-i" parameter, which tells
	  the runners to ignore the rest of the parameters until
	  parameter "--" is seen. Suggestion and initial patch
	  from Jacob Sparre Andersen.
	  Example:
	    my_tests -v -i -this-is-ignored +and-this -- MyTest

	* Old Cruisecontrol and Fedora packaging examples were
	  removed from contrib/ directory.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Fixed compilation with gcc/gnat 4.9. Noticed by John Marino.

Hosting changes
---------------
	* Starting from 2.5, Ahven is no longer hosted at Sourceforge.
	  Instead, it has dedicated site at http://www.ahven-framework.com/

	  Release packages can be downloaded from
	  http://www.ahven-framework.com/releases/

	  Old http://ahven.stronglytyped.org/ address continues work as
	  a mirror site.

	  Source code repository can be accessed either via
	  https://bitbucket.org/tkoskine/ahven or
	  http://hg.stronglytyped.org/ahven
	

2014-02-09 Ahven 2.4
====================

Changes
-------
	* Created a work-around to Ahven.Framework for Apex and ICCAda.
	  Now Apex Ada compiles the the body of Ahven.Framework
	  without errors and ICCAda does not produce any warnings.

	  The compilers did not correctly handle the body of
	  Indefinite_Test_List package inside Ahven.Framework
	  when Indefinite_Test_List was at the end of
	  ahven-framework.adb. This was fixed by moving the body
	  to the beginning of the file. (No functional changes.)

	* Various documentation improvements.
	* Alternative comfignat-based build system (contrib/comfignat)
 	  was added. It is experimental for now and meant mostly for Linux
	  distribution packagers. From Bjorn Persson.

Known issues
------------
	* On Fedora 19/20 you need to first install libgnat-static package:

	  sudo yum install libgnat-static

	  Otherwise GNAT will die with internal error when building Ahven.

	* On Windows 8.1 you need to use JNT_RTS instead of JTN_RTS_Console
	  as Janus/Ada runtime. Otherwise, Janus/Ada fails to find Ada runtime
	  system for Ahven.


2013-01-24 Ahven 2.3
====================

Changes
-------
	* Various procedure descriptions in the API documentation
	  were improved.
	* Character limit of long messages in test results have been
	  increased to 1024. On some compilers this means that
	  memory usage is over 1 kilobytes per test result.
	* New constant: Ahven.Max_Long_String_Len
	* Exception backtraces are now stored to test results
	  when test fails or has an error.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* TAP runner did not output multiline (long) messages correctly.
	  This is now fixed.

Internal
--------
	* New package: Ahven.Long_AStrings
	* Some coding style fixes.

Known issues
------------
	* On Fedora 17/18 you need to first install libgnat-static package:

	  sudo yum install libgnat-static

	  Otherwise GNAT will die with internal error when building Ahven.


2012-03-05 Ahven 2.2
====================

Changes
-------
	* GNAT 3.15p project files from contrib/gnat315p removed.
	* The code snippets in the documentation are now highlighted
	  as Ada code.
	* API documentation generation using Adabrowse is now deprecated.
	  The new way is to use Sphinx for document generation.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Ahven.XML_Runner did not report skipped tests correctly.
	  This is now fixed. (The bug was similar to Ahven.Text_Runner
	  bug in Ahven 2.1.)

Internal
--------
	* Small test suite improvements.

2011-09-24 Ahven 2.1
====================

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Ahven.Text_Runner did not report skipped tests correctly.
	  This is now fixed.

Internal
--------
	* Function Ahven.Results.Skipped_Count was added.

2011-09-23 Ahven 2.0
====================

Changes
-------
	* Tests can be now given a timeout value. If a test is not
	  executed in the given time, it is stopped and a timeout
          failure is reported. See '-t' option of the test runners.
	  The timeout feature depends on the possibility to abort
	  a task after a certain amount of time. If the task abortion
	  is not possible, the current test will continue running
	  even after the given timeout.

	* A test can be now skipped programmatically by calling
	  procedure Skip("Message"). A skipped test are considered
	  to be equal to passed tests, but depending on the test
	  runner, they can have extra "SKIP" information attached.

	* README is now provided in reStructured text format,
	  just like the manual.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Ahven can be compiled on Fedora systems by installing
	  package "libgnat-static". Note: This was not a bug in
	  Ahven but a configuration issue on Fedora.

2011-04-19 Ahven 1.9
====================

Changes
-------
	* Manual was added to 'doc/manual/en' directory. It includes
          User's Guide section and API documentation. The documentation
          is written using reStructuredText and Sphinx 1.0, so Python
          and py-sphinx are required for building. API documentation
          generation via Adabrowse is still supported, but it will be
          deprecated and dropped later.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Extra Test'Class (...) type conversion was removed from
	  ahven-framework.adb. This allows compilation with GNAT GPL 2010.
	  (Bug bitbucket#3)

Internal
--------
	* Package Ahven.VStrings was replaced with an instantiation of
	  Ada.Strings.Bounded.Generic_Bounded_Length. This allowed us to
	  remove over 100 lines of code.

Known issues
------------
	* Ahven (or actually file ahven-parameters.adb) cannot be compiled
	  on Fedora 14 with gcc 4.5.1. See bug
          https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=690610 for details.

2010-06-02 Ahven 1.8
====================

Changes
-------
	* The dynamic library support with GNAT was removed since
	  it did not work automatically in a trouble-free way on
	  Debian, Fedora, and Windows.

	* Ada.Calendar dependency was removed from Ahven.Framework.
	  Equivalent functionality is now implemented in
	  the test runners.

	* Support for TAP 1.3 was dropped. TAP 1.2 is supported
	  normally.

	* Janus/Ada 3.1.1d support was dropped. Ahven now requires
	  Janus/Ada 3.1.2beta or newer.

	* There is now ahven.spec file in contrib/fedora to
	  make packaging and installing Ahven easier on Fedora.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* If user placed a dynamically allocated Test_Case into
	  a statically allocated Test_Suite the finalization
	  procedure tried to release the same memory twice.
	  This is now fixed by implementing Adjust for the
	  Test_Suite type. (Bug bitbucket#2)

	* Many Some_Type'(initial values) expressions were
	  changed into more simpler (initial values) form.
	  This was done to avoid Janus/Ada bug no 73.

Internal
--------
	* Code cleanup: style fixes, removal of compiler warnings
	  and comment clarifications.

	* Remove_All procedure from Ahven.SList package was renamed
	  to Clear. The new name is more consistent with Ada.Containers
	  naming style.

	* Ahven.VStrings package now depends on Ada.Strings.Fixed.

	* Ahven.Framework.Indefinite_Test_List has no longer
	  procedures or functions for Cursors. Same functionality
	  can be now achieved using generic For_Each procedure.

2009-09-14 Ahven 1.7
====================

Changes
-------
	* The source code repository and the issue tracker are
	  now hosted at Bitbucket, http://bitbucket.org/tkoskine/ahven

	* The usage of Unbounded_String was completely removed
	  from all packages. Now Ahven.Framework.Get_Name function
	  returns String.

	* GNAT project files (.gpr) were moved to the 'gnat' directory.

	* The upper limit (Count_Type'Last) of Ahven.SList
	  is now documented.

	* A PDF report generation example from XML result files
	  was added to 'contrib/docbook-testreport'. From Reto Buerki.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Fix Contraint_Error when one tries to truncate
	  overlong string. Bug report and patch from Reto Buerki.
	  (Bug bitbucket#1)

	* XML_Runner now filters special characters like space or /
	  from the filenames. Patch from Reto Buerki.

Internal
--------
	* Makefile now has 'tags' target for generating 'tags' file.
	  It assumes that ctags utility has support for Ada.

	* It is no longer necessary to have procedure or function
	  declarations for all procedures and functions. The purpose
	  is to allow somewhat shorter code.

	* User's Guide has seen some progress, but it is still not
	  completely ready. (=one should not rely on it.)

	* In the test code, some Assert calls were converted to
	  more compact Assert_Equal calls.

2009-02-28 Ahven 1.6
====================

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Installation scripts for GNAT were fixed.
	  Bug report and patch from Reto Buerki.

2009-02-23 Ahven 1.5
====================

Changes
-------
	* Ahven is now hosted at sourceforge.net. New URLs are:
	  Project page: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ahven
	  Home page:    http://ahven.sourceforge.net/

	* Janus/Ada build system was rewritten. See README for details.
	  Also, some minor changes were done to GNAT build scripts.

Bug fixed
---------
	* API documentation was not generated for the Ahven.SList package.

2009-01-22 Ahven 1.4
====================

Changes
-------
	* Type Ahven.Framework.Test_Result and related code was removed.
	  Ahven.Framework.Execute now takes Listeners.Result_Listener'Class
	  directly instead of Test_Result object.

	* New abstract function Test_Count was added to the Test type.
	  The function returns the amount of test routines which will
	  be executed when the Run procedure is called.

	* Test Anything Protocol (TAP) support: There is now a new
	  Ahven.Tap_Runner package, which outputs test results in
	  TAP format (versions 1.2 and 1.3 are supported).

	* Get_Message and Get_Long_Message functions now return String
	  instead of Unbounded_String.

	* The GNAT project files for GNAT 3.15p were synchronised
	  with the GNAT GPL versions.

	* Janus/Ada build scripts are now in the 'janusada' directory
	  instead of 'contrib\janusada'.

	* New (generic) assertion procedure:
	    Assert_Equal (Expected, Actual, Message).
	  Suggestion and the source code from Pawel Plazienski.

	* New procedure for inserting stack-allocated tests into test suites:
	    Add_Static_Test (Suite, T).
	  Idea from Pawel Plazienski.

	* Internally, almost all Unbounded_Strings were converted into
	  VStrings. This limits the maximum length of test names and
	  failure messages to 160 characters. Constraint_Error is
	  raised for overlong test names and too long failure messages
	  are silently truncated into 160 characters.
	  This was done for better Janus/Ada 3.1.1d compatibility.

Bugs fixed
-----------
	* Text-based test runner results are now aligned in a better way.
	  Fix for bug #12220.

Internal
--------
	* All lists were converted into singly linked lists. Lists were
	  made generic wherever possible.

	* Listeners.Output_Capture was combined into Listeners.Basic.

2008-08-13 Ahven 1.3
====================

Changes
-------
	* Example configuration for Cruisecontrol was added.

	* The GNAT project file for GNAT 3.15p was added.

	* Fix for bug #12165 and make test suite to work
	  with Janus/Ada 3.1.x.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* The API documentation is now generated also for
	  the Ahven.Compat and Ahven.XML_Runner packages.

	* The use of System.Address_To_Access_Conversions was removed.
	  This allows Ahven to be compiled with Janus/Ada.
	  At the same time, Ahven.Framework.Run (T : Test;...)
	  was changed back to Ahven.Framework.Run (T : in out Test;...).
	  Sorry for the inconvenience.

	* Non-standard pragmas were removed. The code should compile
	  now on multiple Ada compilers without warnings about
	  unrecognised pragmas.

Internal
--------
	* Variable "OS" in Makefile and GNAT project files was renamed
	  to "OS_Version".

	* New tests:
	    Result_Tests.Test_Add_{Pass,Failure,Error},
	    Framework_Tests.Test_Tear_Down,
	    Ahven.Result_Listener_List.Test_Append.

	* Removed tests: List_Tests.*.

	* Code cleanups:
	  + Duplicate code from Text_Runner.Run and XML_Runner.Run
	    moved into Runner.Run_Suite.
	  + Duplicate code from various Framework.Run procedures was
	    moved into Framework.Run_Internal.

	* Ahven.Doubly_Linked_List was removed. This is related
	  to bug #12165.

2008-05-12 Ahven 1.2
====================

Changes
-------
	* New XML_Runner which generates JUnit compatible XML test results.
	  XML_Runner can be either run explicitly or via Text_Runner
	  using the '-x' parameter.

	* Unused access types Test_Access, Test_Case_Class_Access,
	  Test_Case_Access, Test_Suite_Class_Access, Result_Listener_Access,
	  Test_Command_Access, Test_Object_Command_Access,
	  Basic_Listener_Access, and Output_Capture_Listener_Access removed.

	* Ahven.Framework.Run (T : in out Test;...) is changed to
	  Ahven.Framework.Run (T : Test;...), because 'in out' mode
	  was not necessary.

	* New procedures/functions:
	    Ahven.Text_Runner.Run (Suite : Framework.Test_Suite'Class);
	    Ahven.Framework.Create_Suite return Test_Suite;
	  With these, the suite can be created on stack and one does not
	  need to play with access types.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Ahven can be now compiled with GNAT 3.15p.

	* The GNAT project file should work on Windows again.

Internal
--------
	* XML_Runner introduced a need for some platform specific files.
	  Therefore, 'src' directory now contains subdirectories 'unix'
	  and 'windows'.

	* New tests: Result_Tests.Test_*

	* Next_* procedures for in the Results package were replaced
	  with proper iterators.

2008-01-30 Ahven 1.1
====================

Changes
-------
	* The Ahven.Framework and the test runners are able to optionally
	  run only the tests which match the given name.

	* The default Text_Runner is able to capture Ada.Text_IO output
	  from a test into a temporary file and show the output if
	  the test does not pass.
	  Option '-c' turns the capture feature on.

	* The default Text_Runner shows the exception message in addition
	  to the exception name when the test ends in error.
	  (Idea and original patch from Alexander Senier)

	* The default Text_Runner is now able to provide a short summary
	  instead of full test report.
	  Use option '-q' to get the test summary.

	* The GNAT project file is now called 'ahven.gpr' instead of
	  old 'ahven_lib.gpr'.

	* ALI files (*.ali) are now installed read-only, so GNAT
	  does not try to rebuild the library.
	  (Patch from Alexander Senier)

	* Function Ahven.Framework.Name is renamed
	  to Ahven.Framework.Get_Name.

	* Shared library produced by GNAT now includes the version number.

Internal
--------
	* New listener: Output_Capture_Listener, which will
	  forward Ada.Text_IO output into a temporary file.

	* Type Ahven.Results.Result_Place is renamed to
	  Ahven.Results.Result_Info.

	* Ahven.Double_Linked_List is renamed to Ahven.Doubly_Linked_List,
	  because other Ada linked list implementations also use
	  similar naming scheme.

	* AdaControl is used to enforce some parts of the coding style.
	  This caused some API changes, but in most cases the changes
	  are invisible.

2007-10-24 Ahven 1.0
====================
Initial release.

Ahven is a simple unit test library for Ada 95.
It is modeled after JUnit and some ideas are
taken from AUnit. Ahven 1.0 is distributed under
ISC license.

Features
========
* Test, Test_Case, and Test_Suite classes (tagged types)
* Assert and Fail procedures for triggering assertion failures
* Text-based test runner
