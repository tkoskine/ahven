Ahven - Unit Test Library for Ada
=================================
Ahven is a simple unit test library for Ada.
It is mostly written because I had a need for
one and the only existing unit test library,
AUnit, requires Ada 2005 and is a pure GPL project.

Instead, Ahven is Ada95 code and distributed
under ISC license, so it can be used with older
projects and does not infect GPL to the whole
project.

Building and Installing Ahven
=============================
For building Ahven source code you need Ada95
compiler. In theory, any Ada95 compiler works,
but only GCC (GNAT) is tested.

The default Makefile compiles code using gnatmake,
so if you use another compiler, you need to customize
the Makefile by yourself. When using GNAT, simple
'make' will compile the library and the unit tests.

Command 'make check' will run the unit tests.

If you want to build the API documentation, you
need AdaBrowse tool.

Installation happens by typing 'make install'
or 'make PREFIX=/my/ada/code install'. Alternatively,
you can simply copy the source code directory ('src')
to your project.
