Ahven - Roadmap
================

Release schedule and versioning
-------------------------------
Ahven will use simple a.b versions. After "a.9" comes "(a+1).0".
I plan to release a new version every three or four months.


Planned features
----------------
Version 1.1:
* Track the execution time of the tests

Version ?.?:
* Graphical (GTK+) UI for the test result reporter
* Improve documentation
