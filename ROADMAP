Ahven - Roadmap
================

Release schedule and versioning
-------------------------------
Ahven will use simple a.b version numbers. After "1.9" comes "2.0".
I plan to release a new version two or three times a year.

Planned features
----------------
Version 1.1:
* Refactor Ahven.Results.Result_Place. It is somewhat unsafe to use now.

Version ?.?:
* Graphical (GTK+) UI for the test result reporter
* Improve documentation
