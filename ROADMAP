Ahven - Roadmap
================

Release schedule and versioning
-------------------------------
Ahven will use simple a.b version numbers. After "1.9" comes "2.0".
I plan to release a new version two or three times a year.

API stability
-------------
I do not guarantee API stability but I will try to keep
specification of packages Ahven and Ahven.Framework unchanged.
But for example, function Ahven.Framework.Name changed to
Ahven.Framework.Get_Name in Ahven 1.1.

Other packages will most likely see changes.

Long-term todo-list
-------------------
* Graphical (GTK+/CLAW) UI for the test result reporter
* Improve documentation
* Replace adhoc XML writer with "a proper solution"
