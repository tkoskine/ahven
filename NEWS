????-??-?? Ahven 1.3
====================

Bugs fixed
----------
	* The API documentation is now generated also for
	  the Ahven.Compat and Ahven.XML_Runner packages.

Internal
--------
	* New Tests: Result_Tests.Test_Add_{Pass,Failure,Error}

	* Code cleanups: Duplicate code from Text_Runner.Run and
	  XML_Runner.Run moved into Runner.Run_Suite.

2008-05-12 Ahven 1.2
====================

Changes
-------
	* New XML_Runner which generates JUnit compatible XML test results.
	  XML_Runner can be either run explicitly or via Text_Runner
	  using the '-x' parameter.

	* Unused access types Test_Access, Test_Case_Class_Access,
	  Test_Case_Access, Test_Suite_Class_Access, Result_Listener_Access,
	  Test_Command_Access, Test_Object_Command_Access,
	  Basic_Listener_Access, and Output_Capture_Listener_Access removed.

	* Ahven.Framework.Run (T : in out Test;...) is changed to
	  Ahven.Framework.Run (T : Test;...), because 'in out' mode
	  was not necessary.

	* New procedures/functions:
	    Ahven.Text_Runner.Run (Suite : Framework.Test_Suite'Class);
	    Ahven.Framework.Create_Suite return Test_Suite;
	  With these, the suite can be created on stack and one does not
	  need to play with access types.

Bugs fixed
----------
	* Ahven can be now compiled with GNAT 3.15p.

	* The GNAT project file should work on Windows again.

Internal
--------
	* XML_Runner introduced a need for some platform specific files.
	  Therefore, 'src' directory now contains subdirectories 'unix'
	  and 'windows'.

	* New tests: Result_Tests.Test_*

	* Next_* procedures for in the Results package were replaced
	  with proper iterators.

2008-01-30 Ahven 1.1
====================

Changes
-------
	* The Ahven.Framework and the test runners are able to optionally
	  run only the tests which match the given name.

	* The default Text_Runner is able to capture Ada.Text_IO output
	  from a test into a temporary file and show the output if
	  the test does not pass.
	  Option '-c' turns the capture feature on.

	* The default Text_Runner shows the exception message in addition
	  to the exception name when the test ends in error.
	  (Idea and original patch from Alexander Senier)

	* The default Text_Runner is now able to provide a short summary
	  instead of full test report.
	  Use option '-q' to get the test summary.

	* The GNAT project file is now called 'ahven.gpr' instead of
	  old 'ahven_lib.gpr'.

	* ALI files (*.ali) are now installed read-only, so GNAT
	  does not try to rebuild the library.
	  (Patch from Alexander Senier)

	* Function Ahven.Framework.Name is renamed
	  to Ahven.Framework.Get_Name.

	* Shared library produced by GNAT now includes the version number.

Internal
--------
	* New listener: Output_Capture_Listener, which will
	  forward Ada.Text_IO output into a temporary file.

	* Type Ahven.Results.Result_Place is renamed to
	  Ahven.Results.Result_Info.

	* Ahven.Double_Linked_List is renamed to Ahven.Doubly_Linked_List,
	  because other Ada linked list implementations also use
	  similar naming scheme.

	* AdaControl is used to enforce some parts of the coding style.
	  This caused some API changes, but in most cases the changes
	  are invisible.
