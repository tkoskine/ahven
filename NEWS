????-??-?? Ahven 1.1
====================

Changes
-------
	* The Ahven.Framework and the test runners are able to run
	  only the tests which match the given name.

	* The default Text_Runner will capture Ada.Text_IO output
	  from a test into a temporary file and show the output if
	  the test does not pass.

	* The GNAT project file is now called 'ahven.gpr' instead of
	  old 'ahven_lib.gpr'.

Internal
--------
	* New listener: Output_Capture_Listener, which will
	  forward Ada.Text_IO output into a temporary file.

	* Type Ahven.Results.Result_Place is renamed to
	  Ahven.Results.Result_Info.

	* Ahven.Double_Linked_List is renamed to Ahven.Doubly_Linked_List,
	  because other Ada linked list implementations also use
	  similar naming scheme.

	* AdaControl is used to enforce some parts of the coding style.
